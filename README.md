# Miden-Game-of-Life
Here you can play a Miden Assembly file to play the Game of Life. 
`cargo run` is the command you need.
Don't click `prove` ... it crashes ...

# To-Dos:

- [ ] Prove crashes for some reason?!
- [ ] `trunk build --release.` which is necessary to deploy to GitHub Pages
        -> follow https://github.com/emilk/eframe_template/
- [ ] Add functionality to `Verify` Button
- [ ] Change checkboxes to coloured, clickable boxes
- [ ] Add functionality to see univere evolving -> maybe change in Miden needed
